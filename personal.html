      <h2>Philanthropy</h2>
      <p>
        Musk is chairman of the Musk Foundation, which states its purpose is to
        provide solar-power energy systems in disaster areas as well as other
        goals.[365][201] In 2010, the Musk Foundation collaborated with
        SolarCity to donate a 25 kW solar power system to the South Bay
        Community Alliance's hurricane response center in Coden, Alabama.[366]
        In July 2011, the Musk Foundation donated US$250,000 towards a solar
        power project in Sōma, Japan, a city that had been recently devastated
        by a tsunami.[367]
      </p>

      <p>
        In July 2014, Musk was asked by cartoonist Matthew Inman and William
        Terbo, the grandnephew of Nikola Tesla, to donate US$8 million toward
        the construction of the Tesla Science Center at Wardenclyffe.[368]
        Ultimately, Musk agreed to donate US$1 million toward the project and
        additionally pledged to build a Tesla Supercharger in the museum car
        park.[369]
      </p>

      <p>
        In January 2015, Musk donated US$10 million to the Future of Life
        Institute to run a global research program aimed at keeping artificial
        intelligence beneficial to humanity.[370][320][371]
      </p>

      <p>
        As of 2015, Musk is a trustee of the X Prize Foundation[372][non-primary
        source needed] and a signatory of The Giving Pledge.[373]
      </p>

      <p>
        In October 2018, in an effort to help solve the Flint water crisis, Musk
        and the Musk Foundation donated over $480,000 to install new water
        fountains with filtration systems for access to clean water at all
        Flint, Michigan schools.[374] As of 2019, approximately 30,000 children
        in all 12 area schools have free, safe drinking water from the water
        filtration systems.[375]
      </p>

      <p>Musk has been a top donor for the ACLU.[376]</p>

      <p>
        In October 2019, Musk donated US$1 million to '#TeamTrees' a tree
        planting initiative to plant 20 million trees led by the YouTube
        community[note 3] and in collaboration with Arbor Day
        Foundation.[377][378][379]
      </p>

      <h2>Family</h2>

      <p>
        Musk met his first wife, Canadian author Justine Wilson, while both were
        students at Ontario's Queen's University. They married in 2000 and
        separated in 2008.[381] Their first son, Nevada Alexander Musk, died of
        sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) at the age of 10 weeks.[382] They
        later had five sons through in vitro fertilization[383]—twins in 2004
        (Griffin and Xavier), followed by triplets in 2006 (Kai, Saxon, and
        Damian). They share custody of all five sons.[384]
      </p>

      <p>
        In 2008, Musk began dating English actress Talulah Riley, and in 2010,
        the couple married. In January 2012, Musk announced that he had ended
        his four-year relationship with Riley,[35][385] tweeting to Riley, "It
        was an amazing four years. I will love you forever. You will make
        someone very happy one day."[386] In July 2013, Musk and Riley
        remarried. In December 2014, Musk filed for a second divorce from Riley;
        however, the action was withdrawn.[387] The media announced in March
        2016 that divorce proceedings were again underway, this time with Riley
        filing for divorce from Musk.[388][389] The divorce was finalized in
        late 2016.[390]
      </p>

      <p>
        Musk began dating American actress Amber Heard in 2016, they split up
        after one year due to their conflicting schedules.[391][392]
      </p>

      <p>
        On May 7, 2018, Musk and Canadian musician Grimes revealed that they had
        begun dating.[393][394][395] On January 8, 2020, Grimes announced that
        she was pregnant with their first child.[396][397] Grimes gave birth to
        a son on May 4, 2020.[398][399] According to Musk and Grimes, his name
        was "X Æ A-12" (pronounced "Ex Ash A Twelve"[400] or "Ex Aye Eye"[401]),
        however the name was deemed illegal under California law, because it
        contained characters that are not in the modern English alphabet,[402]
        and was then changed to "X Æ A-Xii", this drew confusion, as Æ is still
        not in the modern English alphabet.[403] The child was eventually named
        "X AE A-XII", with "X" as a first name and "AE A-XII" as a middle
        name.[b][405]
      </p>

      <h2>Joe Rogan podcast appearance</h2>

      <p>
        On September 6, 2018, Musk appeared on The Joe Rogan Experience podcast
        and discussed various topics for over two hours. Within five days, the
        appearance had accrued 10 million YouTube views.[406] One of the highest
        profile and controversial aspects of the program was Musk's sampling a
        single puff from a cigar consisting, Rogan claimed, of tobacco laced
        with cannabis. To Rogan's inquiry on how often he smoked cannabis, Musk
        replied: "Almost never. I know a lot of people like weed and that's
        fine, but I don't find that is very good for productivity ... not for
        me." The Washington Post observed, "In the media's hands, it became a
        story about Musk's growing instability ..."[407] Tesla stock dropped
        after the incident, which coincided with the confirmation of the
        departure of Tesla's Vice President of Worldwide Finance Justin McAnear
        earlier that day.[408] Fortune wondered if the cannabis use could have
        ramifications for SpaceX contracts with the United States Air Force,
        though a USAF spokesperson told The Verge that there was no
        investigation being carried out and that the Air Force is still
        processing the situation.[409][410] In an interview on 60 Minutes, Musk
        said of the cannabis-smoking incident: "I do not smoke pot. As anybody
        who watched that podcast could tell, I have no idea how to smoke
        pot."[411]
