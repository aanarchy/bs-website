        Born to a Canadian mother and South African father, Musk was born and
        raised in Pretoria, South Africa. He briefly attended the University of
        Pretoria before moving to Canada when he was 17 to attend Queen's
        University. He transferred to the University of Pennsylvania two years
        later, where he received a bachelor's degree in economics from the
        Wharton School and a bachelor's degree in physics from the College of
        Arts and Sciences. He moved to California in 1995 to begin a Ph.D. in
        applied physics and material sciences at Stanford University, but
        decided to pursue a business career instead of enrolling. He
        subsequently co-founded (with his brother Kimbal) Zip2, a web software
        company, which was acquired by Compaq for $340 million in 1999. Musk
        then founded X.com, an online bank. It merged with Confinity in 2000,
        which had launched PayPal the previous year and was subsequently bought
        by eBay for $1.5 billion in October 2002.

        In May 2002, Musk founded SpaceX, an aerospace manufacturer and space
        transport services company, of which he is CEO and lead designer. He
        joined Tesla Motors, Inc. (now Tesla, Inc.), an electric vehicle
        manufacturer, in 2004, the year after it was founded, and became its CEO
        and product architect. In 2006, he helped create SolarCity, a solar
        energy services company (now a subsidiary of Tesla). In 2015, Musk
        co-founded OpenAI, a nonprofit research company that aims to promote
        friendly artificial intelligence. In July 2016, he co-founded Neuralink,
        a neurotechnology company focused on developing brain–computer
        interfaces. In December 2016, Musk founded The Boring Company, an
        infrastructure and tunnel construction company focused on tunnels
        optimized for electric vehicles.

        In addition to his primary business pursuits, Musk has envisioned a
        high-speed transportation system known as the Hyperloop. Musk has said
        the goals of SpaceX, Tesla, and SolarCity revolve around his vision to
        "change the world and help humanity". His goals include reducing global
        warming through sustainable energy production and consumption and
        lessening the risk of human extinction by establishing a human colony on
        Mars.
