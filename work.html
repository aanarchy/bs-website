      <h1>Career</h1>
      Zip2 Main article: Zip2 In 1995, Musk and his brother, Kimbal, started
      Zip2, a web software company, with money raised from a small group of
      angel investors.[40] The company developed and marketed an internet city
      guide for the newspaper publishing industry, with maps, directions and
      yellow pages,[63] with the vector graphics mapping and direction code
      being implemented by Musk in Java.[64][better source needed] Musk obtained
      contracts with The New York Times and the Chicago Tribune,[65][66] and
      persuaded the board of directors to abandon plans for a merger with
      CitySearch.[67] Musk's attempts to become CEO were thwarted by the
      board.[43] Compaq acquired Zip2 for US$307 million in cash[43]:109 in
      February 1999.[68] Musk received US$22 million for his 7 percent share
      from the sale.[65][43]:109[66] X.com and PayPal Main articles: PayPal and
      X.com In March 1999, Musk co-founded X.com, an online financial services
      and e-mail payment company, with US$10 million from the sale of
      Zip2.[67][66] One year later, the company merged with Confinity,[65][69]
      which had a money-transfer service called PayPal.[66] The merged company
      focused on the PayPal service and was renamed PayPal in 2001.[70] Musk was
      ousted in October 2000 from his role as CEO (although he remained on the
      board) due to disagreements with other company executives over his desire
      to move PayPal's Unix-based infrastructure to a Microsoft one.[71] In
      October 2002, PayPal was acquired by eBay for US$1.5 billion in stock, of
      which Musk received US$165 million.[citation needed] Before its sale,
      Musk, who was the company's largest shareholder, owned 11.7% of PayPal's
      shares.[72][non-primary source needed] In July 2017, Musk purchased the
      domain X.com from PayPal for an undisclosed amount, stating that it has
      sentimental value to him.[73] SpaceX Main article: SpaceX In 2001, Musk
      conceived Mars Oasis, an idea to land a miniature experimental greenhouse
      on Mars, containing food crops growing on Martian regolith, in an attempt
      to reawaken public interest in space exploration.[74][75] In October 2001,
      Musk traveled to Moscow with Jim Cantrell (an aerospace supplies fixer),
      and Adeo Ressi (his best friend from college), to buy refurbished Dnepr
      Intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) that could send the envisioned
      payloads into space. The group met with companies such as NPO Lavochkin
      and Kosmotras; however, according to Cantrell, Musk was seen as a novice
      and was consequently spat on by one of the Russian chief designers.[76]
      The group returned to the United States empty-handed. In February 2002,
      the group returned to Russia to look for three ICBMs, bringing along Mike
      Griffin. Griffin had worked for the CIA's venture capital arm, In-Q-Tel,
      as well as NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, and was just leaving Orbital
      Sciences, a maker of satellites and spacecraft. The group had another
      meeting with Kosmotras and were offered one rocket for US$8 million. Musk
      considered the price too high, and stormed out of the meeting. On the
      flight back from Moscow, Musk realized that he could start a company that
      could build the affordable rockets he needed.[76] According to early Tesla
      and SpaceX investor Steve Jurvetson,[77] Musk calculated that the raw
      materials for building a rocket were only 3 percent of the sales price of
      a rocket at the time. It was concluded that[by whom?], in theory, by
      applying vertical integration and the modular approach employed in
      software engineering, SpaceX could cut launch price by a factor of ten and
      still enjoy a 70-percent gross margin.[78][better source needed]
      Ultimately, Musk ended up founding SpaceX with the long-term goal of
      creating a true spacefaring civilization.[79][citation needed] Musk and
      President Barack Obama at the Falcon 9 launch site in 2010 With US$100
      million of his early fortune,[80] Musk founded Space Exploration
      Technologies Corp., traded as SpaceX, in May 2002.[81] Musk is chief
      executive officer (CEO) and chief technology officer (CTO) of the
      Hawthorne, California-based company. By 2016, Musk's private trust held
      54% of SpaceX stock, equivalent to 78% of voting shares.[82] SpaceX
      develops and manufactures space launch vehicles with a focus on advancing
      the state of rocket technology. The company's first two launch vehicles
      were the Falcon 1 and Falcon 9 rockets (a nod to Star Wars' Millennium
      Falcon), and its first spacecraft was the Dragon (a nod to Puff the Magic
      Dragon).[83][failed verification] SpaceX designed a family of launch
      vehicles and the Dragon multipurpose spacecraft over a span of seven
      years. In September 2008, SpaceX's Falcon 1 rocket became the first
      privately funded liquid-fueled vehicle to put a satellite into Earth
      orbit.[43] SpaceX is both the largest private producer of rocket engines
      in the world and holder of the record for the highest thrust-to-weight
      ratio for a rocket engine (the Merlin 1D).[84][85] SpaceX has produced
      more than 100 operational Merlin 1D engines. According to SpaceX, each
      Merlin 1D engine can vertically lift the weight of 40 average family cars,
      and in combination, the 9 Merlin engines in the Falcon 9 first stage
      produce anywhere from 5.8 to 6.7 MN (1.3 to 1.5 million pounds) of thrust,
      depending on altitude.[86] NASA Administrator Charles Bolden congratulates
      Musk in front of the Dragon capsule in 2012, following the first
      successful mission by a private company to carry supplies to the
      International Space Station In 2006, NASA announced that the company was
      one of two selected to provide crew and cargo resupply demonstration
      contracts to the International Space Station,[87] followed by a US$1.6
      billion Commercial Resupply Services program contract on December 23,
      2008, for 12 flights of its Falcon 9 rocket and Dragon spacecraft to the
      Space Station, replacing the US Space Shuttle after it retired in
      2011.[88] On May 25, 2012, the SpaceX Dragon vehicle berthed with the ISS,
      making history as the first commercial company to launch and berth a
      vehicle to the International Space Station.[89] Starting in 2011, SpaceX
      received funding under NASA's Commercial Crew Development program, to
      develop the Dragon 2 crew capsule.[90] A contract to provide crew flights
      to the ISS was awarded in 2014.[91] Musk believed the key to making space
      travel affordable was to make rockets reusable, though space industry
      experts[who?] believed reusable rockets were impossible or
      infeasible.[92][full citation needed] On December 22, 2015, SpaceX
      successfully landed the first stage of its Falcon rocket back at the
      launch pad, the first time this had been achieved by an orbital
      rocket.[93] The first stage recovery was replicated several times in 2016
      by landing on an autonomous spaceport drone ship, an ocean-based recovery
      platform,[94] and by the end of 2017, SpaceX had landed and recovered the
      first stage on 16 consecutive missions where a landing and recovery were
      attempted, including all 14 attempts in 2017. Twenty out of 42 first stage
      Falcon 9 boosters have been recovered overall since the Falcon 9 maiden
      flight in 2010.[95] In 2017 SpaceX launched 18 successful missions, more
      than doubling their highest previous year of 8.[96] Large circular disc of

      orbit after the Falcon Heavy test flight in 2018 On February 6, 2018,
      SpaceX successfully launched the Falcon Heavy, the fourth-highest capacity
      rocket ever built (after Saturn V, Energia and N1) and the most powerful
      rocket in operation as of 2018.[citation needed] The inaugural mission
      carried a Tesla Roadster belonging to Musk as a dummy payload.[97][98]
      SpaceX began development of the Starlink constellation of low Earth orbit
      satellites in 2015 to provide satellite Internet access, with the first
      two prototype test-flight satellites launched in February 2018. A second
      set of test satellites and the first large deployment of a piece of the
      constellation occurred on May 24, 2019 UTC when the first 60 operational
      satellites were launched.[99][100] The total cost of the decade-long
      project to design, build, and deploy the constellation was estimated by
      SpaceX in May 2018 to be about US$10 billion.[101] Musk was influenced by
      Isaac Asimov's Foundation series[102] and views space exploration as an
      important step in preserving and expanding the consciousness of human
      life.[103] Musk said that multiplanetary life may serve as a hedge against
      threats to the survival of the human species: SpaceX DM-1 preflight. Musk
      (furthest left) with members of NASA, March 2019 An asteroid or a super
      volcano could destroy us, and we face risks the dinosaurs never saw: an
      engineered virus, inadvertent creation of a micro black hole, catastrophic
      global warming or some as-yet-unknown technology could spell the end of
      us. Humankind evolved over millions of years, but in the last sixty years,
      atomic weaponry created the potential to extinguish ourselves. Sooner or
      later, we must expand life beyond this green and blue ball—or go extinct.
      Space X's goal is to reduce the cost of human spaceflight by a factor of
      10.[104] In a 2011 interview, he said he hopes to send humans to Mars'
      surface within 10–20 years.[105][citation needed] In Ashlee Vance's
      biography, Musk stated that he wants to establish a Mars colony by 2040,
      with a population of 80,000.[44] Musk stated that, since Mars' atmosphere
      lacks oxygen, all transportation would have to be electric (electric cars,
      electric trains, Hyperloop, electric aircraft).[citation needed] Musk
      stated in June 2016 that the first uncrewed flight of the larger
      Interplanetary Spaceship was aimed for departure to the red planet in
      2022, to be followed by the first crewed ITS Mars flight departing in
      2024.[106] In September 2016, Musk revealed details of his architecture to
      explore and colonize Mars.[107] Musk explains the planned capabilities of
      Starship to NORAD and Air Force Space Command in April 2019 In late 2017,
      SpaceX unveiled the design for its next-generation launch vehicle and
      spacecraft system, Big Falcon Rocket (BFR), that would support all SpaceX
      launch service provider capabilities with a single set of very large
      vehicles: Earth-orbit, Lunar-orbit, interplanetary missions, and even
      intercontinental passenger transport on Earth, and totally replace the
      Falcon 9, Falcon Heavy and Dragon vehicles in the 2020s. Starship will
      have a 9-meter (30 ft) core diameter. Significant development on the
      vehicles began in 2017, with an initial prototype unveiled in September
      2019,[108] while the new rocket engine (Raptor) development began in
      2012,[109][110] with a first test flight performed in August
      2019.[111][better source needed] In a September 2018 announcement of a
      planned 2023 lunar circumnavigation mission, a private flight called
      #dearMoon project,[112] Musk showed a redesigned concept for the BFR
      second stage and spaceship with three rear fins and two front canard fins
      added for atmospheric entry, replacing the previous delta wing and split
      flaps shown a year earlier. The revised BFR design was to use seven
      identically-sized Raptor engines in the second stage; the same engine
      model as would be used on the first stage. The second stage design had two
      small actuating canard fins near the nose of the ship, and three large
      fins at the base, two of which would actuate, with all three serving as
      landing legs.[113] Additionally, SpaceX also stated later that September
      that they were "no longer planning to upgrade Falcon 9 second stage for
      reusability."[114] The two major parts of the re-designed BFR were given
      descriptive names in November: "Starship" for the upper stage[a] and
      "Super Heavy" for the booster stage, which Musk said was "needed to escape
      Earth's deep gravity well (not needed for other planets or moons)."[115]
      On May 30, 2020, SpaceX launched its first manned flight called Demo-2
      becoming the first private company to both place a person into orbit and
      to eventually dock a manned space-craft with the ISS.[116] Further, the
      launch was the first time since the end of the Shuttle Program that an
      American Astronaut has been launched from American soil on an American
      rocket.[117] Tesla Main article: Tesla, Inc. Tesla, Inc. (originally Tesla
      Motors) was incorporated in July 2003 by Martin Eberhard and Marc
      Tarpenning, who financed the company until the Series A round of
      funding.[118] Both men played active roles in the company's early
      development prior to Elon Musk's involvement.[119] Musk led the Series A
      round of investment in February 2004, joining Tesla's board of directors
      as its chairman.[120][121][21][122] According to Musk, all three, along
      with J. B. Straubel, were inspired by the earlier AC Propulsion tzero
      electric roadster prototype.[123] Musk took an active role within the
      company and oversaw Roadster product design at a detailed level, but was
      not deeply involved in day-to-day business operations.[124][failed
      verification][non-primary source needed] Following the financial crisis in
      2008 and after a series of escalating conflicts in 2007, Eberhard was
      ousted from the firm.[92][125] Musk assumed leadership of the company as
      CEO and product architect in 2008, positions he still holds today. As of
      2019, Elon Musk is the longest tenured CEO of any automotive manufacturer
      globally.[19] Tesla's "master plan", as iterated by Musk in 2006[126] was:
      Build sports car. Use that money to build an affordable car. Use that
      money to build an even more affordable car. While doing above, also
      provide zero-emission electric power generation options. Tesla Motors
      first built an electric sports car, the Tesla Roadster, in 2008, with
      sales of about 2,500 vehicles to 31 countries. Tesla began delivery of its
      four-door Model S sedan on June 22, 2012. It unveiled its third product,
      the Model X, aimed at the SUV/minivan market, on February 9, 2012;
      however, the Model X launch was delayed until September
      2015.[127][128][129] In addition to its own cars, Tesla sold electric
      powertrain systems to Daimler for the Smart EV, Mercedes B-Class Electric
      Drive and Mercedes A Class, and to Toyota for the RAV4 EV. Musk was able
      to bring in both companies as long-term investors in Tesla.[130] Musk and
      Senator Dianne Feinstein next to a Tesla Model S at the opening of the
      Tesla Factory (2010) Musk observing an assembly demo at the reopening of
      the NUMMI plant, now known as the Tesla Factory (Fremont, California) in
      2010 Musk standing in front of a Tesla Model S in 2011 Musk favored
      building a more affordable Tesla model; this led to the Model 3 that was
      unveiled in 2016, with a planned base price of US$35,000.[126] Initial
      deliveries began in 2017, with the US$35,000 base model becoming available
      in February 2019.[131][132] Musk originally intended to name the model 3
      as the model E but was blocked by Ford which held the trademark, with Musk
      concluding that "Ford was killing SEX".[133][better source needed] Several
      mainstream publications[citation needed] have compared him with Henry Ford
      for his work on advanced vehicle powertrains.[134][failed verification]
      Musk has named the fastest acceleration modes of their vehicles after the
      Spaceballs' starship speeds (Ludicrous Speed, Plaid Speed).[135][136] In a
      May 2013 interview with All Things Digital, Musk said that to overcome the
      range limitations of electric cars, Tesla planned to expand its network of
      supercharger stations, tripling the number on the East and West coasts of
      the U.S. that June, with plans for more expansion across North America,
      including Canada, throughout the year.[137] In 2014, Musk announced that
      Tesla would allow its technology patents to be used by anyone in good
      faith in a bid to entice automobile manufacturers to speed up the
      development of electric cars. "The unfortunate reality is electric car
      programs (or programs for any vehicle that doesn't burn hydrocarbons) at
      the major manufacturers are small to non-existent, constituting an average
      of far less than 1% of their total vehicle sales," Musk said.[138] In
      February 2016, Musk announced that he had acquired the Tesla.com domain
      name from Stu Grossman, who had owned it since 1992, and changed Tesla's
      homepage to that domain.[139] Musk with Indian Prime Minister Narendra
      Modi in San Jose, California, on September 26, 2015 Anticipating that the
      global lithium-ion battery supply was insufficient for their planned
      electric car output, a lithium-ion battery factory that would more than
      double existing global output was planned.[140] On July 29, 2016 the first
      phase of Gigafactory 1, a lithium-ion battery and electric vehicle
      subassembly factory, was officially opened near Reno, Nevada, by Tesla in
      partnership with Panasonic.[141][142] Gigafactory 1 currently produces 35
      GWh/yr of batteries. In July 2016, Musk released Tesla's "master plan part
      2":[143] Create stunning solar roofs with seamlessly integrated battery
      storage. Expand the electric vehicle product line to address all major
      segments [including small SUV and pickup truck]. Develop a self-driving
      capability that is 10X safer than manual via massive fleet learning.
      Enable your car to make money for you when you aren't using it. In July
      2016, Tesla commenced developing their autopilot hardware and software
      in-house, ending their previous partnership with Mobileye.[144] In
      September 2017, Musk arranged a contract with the government of South
      Australia for Tesla Energy to install what would then be the world's
      largest lithium ion battery pack, to help alleviate energy blackouts in
      the state. Famously[peacock term], Musk arranged this on Twitter, with the
      guarantee that it would be installed in 100 days or would be free.[145]
      This deadline was achieved[146] and the resulting battery exceeded
      expected performance and returns,[147][failed verification] despite
      skepticism from Australian federal politicians.[148][149] In September
      2018, Musk was sued by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for a
      tweet claiming that funding had been secured for potentially taking Tesla
      private. The lawsuit claimed that verbal discussions Musk held with
      foreign investors in July 2018 did not confirm key deal terms[150] and
      thus characterized the tweet as false, misleading, and damaging to
      investors, and sought to bar Musk from serving as CEO on publicly traded
      companies.[151][152] Musk called the allegations unjustified and that he
      had never compromised his integrity.[153] Two days later, Musk reached a
      settlement with the SEC, without admitting or denying the SEC's
      allegations. As a result, Musk and Tesla were fined $20 million each, and
      Musk was forced to step down temporarily as Tesla chairman, while
      remaining Tesla's CEO.[154] Musk also proclaimed in several interviews
      since that he does not regret sending the tweet that triggered the SEC
      investigation. According to Reuters, Musk said the tweet was "Worth
      It".[155] According to ABC News, "As recently as Oct. 4 2018, Musk issued
      a sarcastic tweet, describing the agency [SEC] as the 'Shortseller
      Enrichment Commission,' despite having agreed to settlement terms a week
      earlier that his company, Tesla, would monitor his tweets and other
      communications."[156] In a December 2018 interview with CBS's 60 Minutes,
      Musk stated, "I want to be clear. I do not respect the SEC."[157] On
      February 19, 2019, according to Forbes, Musk stated in a tweet that Tesla
      would build half a million cars in 2019.[158] The SEC reacted to Musk's
      tweet by filing in court, initially asking the court to hold him in
      contempt for violating the terms of a settlement agreement with such a
      tweet, which was disputed by Musk. This was eventually settled by a joint
      agreement between Musk and the SEC clarifying the previous agreement
      details.[159] The agreement included a list of topics that Musk would need
      preclearance before tweeting about.[160] In January 2019, Musk traveled to
      China for the groundbreaking of Tesla's Shanghai Gigafactory, which is the
      company's first large-scale plant outside the U.S.[161] Part of his visit
      to China, Musk also met the Chinese premier Li Keqiang. During their
      exchange, Musk expressed his admiration for China and wished he could
      visit China more often, to which the Chinese premier was quoted as saying
      "We can issue you a Chinese green card if that helps."[162][163] The time
      from the initial ground-breaking to production of first cars at the
      Shanghai Gigafactory was achieved in under one year.[164] In March 2019,
      the model Y small SUV/CUV was unveiled.[165] First deliveries were in
      March 2020.[166] Later that year in November, Musk unveiled the Tesla
      Cybertruck, an all-electric battery-powered pickup truck. The reveal was
      in Los Angeles—the same month, year and location that the movie Blade
      Runner, which was a design inspiration, was set in.[167][168][failed
      verification] To be manufactured in three variants of Single Motor RWD,
      Dual Motor AWD and Triple Motor AWD, the Cybertruck is expected to start
      commercial production in late 2021.[169] As of January 29, 2016, Musk
      owned about 28.9 million Tesla shares, which equates to about 22% of the
      company.[170][171] In January 2018, Musk was granted an option to buy up
      to 20.3 million shares if Tesla's market value were to rise to $650
      billion. Majority shareholder approval for this package was approved in
      March 2018.[172] The grant was also meant to end speculation about Musk's
      potential departure from Tesla to devote more time to his other business
      ventures.[173] A report by advisory firm Glass Lewis & Co. to its clients
      argued against granting the options.[citation needed][174] SolarCity Main
      article: SolarCity Musk provided the initial concept and financial capital
      for SolarCity, which was then co-founded in 2006 by his cousins Lyndon and
      Peter Rive.[175][176] By 2013, SolarCity was the second largest provider
      of solar power systems in the United States.[177] SolarCity was acquired
      by Tesla, Inc. in November 2016 and is currently a wholly owned subsidiary
      of Tesla.[178][179][180] The underlying motivation for funding both
      SolarCity and Tesla was to help combat global warming.[181][182] In 2012,
      Musk announced that SolarCity and Tesla would collaborate to use electric
      vehicle batteries to smooth the impact of rooftop solar on the power grid,
      with the program going live in 2013.[183] On June 17, 2014, Musk committed
      to building a SolarCity advanced production facility in Buffalo, New York,
      that would triple the size of the largest solar plant in the United
      States. Musk stated the plant will be "one of the single largest solar
      panel production plants in the world," and it will be followed by one or
      more even bigger facilities in subsequent years.[184] The Tesla
      Gigafactory 2 is a photovoltaic (PV) cell factory, leased by Tesla
      subsidiary SolarCity in Buffalo, New York. Construction on the factory
      started in 2014 and was completed in 2017.[185] Tesla accepted $750
      million in public funds from New York Governor Andrew Cuomo as part of the
      Buffalo Billion project—a plan to invest money to help the economy of the
      Buffalo, New York area—to build the factory and infrastructure.[186]
      Hyperloop Main articles: Hyperloop and Hyperloop pod competition On August
      12, 2013, Musk unveiled a concept for a high-speed transportation system
      incorporating reduced-pressure tubes in which pressurized capsules ride on
      an air cushion driven by linear induction motors and air compressors.[187]
      The mechanism for releasing the concept was an alpha-design document that,
      in addition to scoping out the technology, outlined a notional route where
      such a transport system might be built: between the Greater Los Angeles
      Area and the San Francisco Bay Area.[188] After earlier envisioning
      Hyperloop, Musk assigned a dozen engineers from Tesla and SpaceX who
      worked for nine months, establishing the conceptual foundations and
      creating the designs for the transportation system.[189][190] An early
      design for the system was then published in a whitepaper posted to the
      Tesla and SpaceX blogs.[191][192][193] Musk's proposal, if technologically
      feasible at the costs he has cited, would make Hyperloop travel cheaper
      than any other mode of transport for such long distances. The alpha design
      was proposed to use a partial vacuum to reduce aerodynamic drag, which it
      is theorized would allow for high-speed travel with relatively low power,
      with certain other features like air-bearing skis and an inlet compressor
      to reduce freestream flow. The document of alpha design estimated the
      total cost of an LA-to-SF Hyperloop system at US$6 billion, but this
      amount is speculative.[194] In June 2015, Musk announced a design
      competition for students and others to build Hyperloop pods to operate on
      a SpaceX-sponsored mile-long track in a 2015–2017 Hyperloop pod
      competition. The track was used in January 2017, and Musk also started
      building a tunnel.[195] Hyperloop One, a company unaffiliated with Musk,
      had announced that it had done its first successful test run on its
      DevLoop track in Nevada on July 13, 2017. It was on May 12, 2017, at 12:02
      a.m. and had lasted 5.3 seconds, reaching a top speed of 70 mph.[196] On
      July 20, 2017, Elon Musk said that he had received what he described as
      "verbal government approval" to build a hyperloop from New York City to
      Washington, D.C., stopping in both Philadelphia and Baltimore.[197] OpenAI
      Main article: OpenAI In December 2015, Musk announced the creation of
      OpenAI, a not-for-profit artificial intelligence (AI) research company.
      OpenAI aims to develop artificial general intelligence in a way that is
      safe and beneficial to humanity.[198] By making AI available to everyone,
      OpenAI wants to "counteract large corporations who may gain too much power
      by owning super-intelligence systems devoted to profits, as well as
      governments which may use AI to gain power and even oppress their
      citizenry."[199] Musk has stated he wants to counteract the concentration
      of power.[40] In 2018 Musk left the OpenAI board to avoid possible future
      conflicts with his role as CEO of Tesla as Tesla increasingly became
      involved in AI through Tesla Autopilot.[200] In an interview with Joe
      Rogan in September 2018, Musk expressed his concerns about the dangers of
      developing artificial intelligence indiscriminately. In January 2019 Mark
      Harris of The Guardian noted that on January 23, 2019 the Musk foundation
      "added a line to its website, stating its support for the "development of
      safe artificial intelligence to benefit humanity"".[201] Neuralink Main
      article: Neuralink In 2016, Musk co-founded Neuralink, a neurotechnology
      startup company to integrate the human brain with artificial intelligence.
      The company is centered on creating devices that can be implanted in the
      human brain, with the eventual purpose of helping human beings merge with
      software and keep pace with advancements in artificial intelligence. These
      enhancements could improve memory or allow more direct interfacing with
      computing devices.[202] Musk sees Neuralink and OpenAI as related: "OpenAI
      is a nonprofit dedicated to minimizing the dangers of artificial
      intelligence, while Neuralink is working on ways to implant technology
      into our brains to create mind-computer interfaces."[40] The Boring
      Company Main article: The Boring Company Musk discussing The Boring
      Company at TED 2017 On December 17, 2016, while stuck in traffic, Musk
      tweeted "[I] am going to build a tunnel boring machine and just start
      digging ..." The company was named 'The Boring Company' (TBC).[203] On
      January 21, 2017, Musk tweeted "Exciting progress on the tunnel front.
      Plan to start digging in a month or so."[204] As of January 26, 2017,
      discussions with regulatory bodies had begun.[205] In February 2017, the
      company began digging a 30-foot (9.1 m) wide, 50-foot (15 m) long, and
      15-foot (4.6 m) deep "test trench" on the premises of Space X's offices in
      Los Angeles, since the construction requires no permits.[206][207] Musk
      had said in early 2017 that a 10-fold decrease in tunnel boring cost per
      mile is necessary for economic feasibility of the proposed tunnel
      network.[208] According to Tesla and SpaceX board member Steve Jurvets,
      the tunnel width is optimized for electric vehicles only, which avoids
      complications of exhaust venting with internal combustion engines.[209] By
      late 2018, TBC had active construction, approved plans in place, or an
      operational tunnel in several areas of the United States: Baltimore,[210]
      Chicago[211] and Los Angeles. TBC provided an update on the state of their
      technology and product line when they opened to the public their first
      mile-long test tunnel in Hawthorne, California, on December 18, 2018,
      saying it has been a proof-of-concept for the technology.[212][213] TBC
      has claimed that design is complete for their next tunnel boring machine
      (TBM), Prufrock, and that assembly and engineering testing would begin in
      2019.[212]:15:18–15:45 In February 2020 TBC released images of a working
      Prufrock prototype.[214] As merchandising, Musk said the company sold
      2,000 "flamethrowers" in 2018,[215][216] inspired by the movie
      Spaceballs.[217][218][failed verification] Tham Luang cave rescue In July
      2018, Musk attempted to provide assistance to rescuers during the Tham
      Luang cave rescue by arranging for his employees to build a small rescue
      pod.[citation needed] Musk, responding to requests for help from Twitter
      users,[219] offered help; his The Boring Company contacted the Thai
      government.[220] He then arranged for engineers from two of his companies
      to design a child-sized submarine to help the rescue effort and documented
      the process via Twitter.[221][222] Richard Stanton, leader of the
      international rescue diving team, also urged Musk to continue construction
      of the mini-submarine as a back-up, in case flooding worsened.[223]
      Engineers at Musk's companies SpaceX and The Boring Company built the
      mini-submarine out of a Falcon 9 liquid oxygen transfer tube[224] in 8
      hours and personally delivered it to Thailand.[225] Named "Wild Boar"
      after the children's soccer team,[226] its design, based on dive team
      feedback, was a five-foot (1.5 m)-long, twelve-inch (300 mm)-inch wide
      sealed tube weighing about 90 pounds (41 kg) propelled manually by divers
      in the front and back with segmented compartments to place diver weights
      to adjust buoyancy,[225][227] intended to solve the problem of safely
      transporting the children who might have had difficulty learning the scuba
      skills required to exit the cave on their own without panicking. In case
      the mini-submarine could not fit through the cave system, Elon Musk also
      requested Wing Inflatables, a California-based inflatable boat
      manufacturer, to build inflatable escape pods. The pods were designed,
      fabricated, and tested in one day before being flown to
      Thailand.[228][229] By this time, eight of the twelve children had already
      been rescued (using full face masks and oxygen under
      anesthesia[230][231][232]) and Thai authorities decided not to use the
      submarine.[233][234][235] Elon Musk was later one of the 187 people
      awarded a Member of the Order of the Direkgunabhorn (fifth class) by the
      King of Thailand in March 2019 for his and his team's contributions to the
      rescue mission.[236][non-primary source needed] Device viability and
      backlash The supervisor of the rescue operation Narongsak Osatanakorn
      stated that the submarine was "technologically sophisticated, [but] it
      doesn't fit with our mission to go in the cave".[237][238] Vernon
      Unsworth, a recreational caver who had been exploring the cave for the
      previous six years and who had played a key advisory role in the rescue,
      criticized the submarine on CNN as amounting to nothing more than a public
      relations effort with no chance of success, and that Musk "had no
      conception of what the cave passage was like"[239][240][241] and "can
      stick his submarine where it hurts". Musk asserted on Twitter that the
      device would have worked and referred to Unsworth as "pedo guy", causing
      backlash against Musk.[242][243] He subsequently deleted the tweets, along
      with an earlier tweet in which he told another critic of the device, "Stay
      tuned jackass."[243] On July 16, Unsworth stated that he was considering
      legal action in relation to Musk's comments.[244][245] Two days later,
      Musk issued an apology for his remarks.[246][247][248][249] On August 28,
      2018, in response to criticism from a writer on Twitter, Musk tweeted "You
      don't think it's strange he hasn't sued me?"[250] The following day, a
      letter from L. Lin Wood, the rescuer's attorney, dated August 6, emerged,
      showing that he had been making preparations for a libel
      lawsuit.[251][252] At some point, a self-proclaimed private investigator
      emailed Musk with an offer to "dig deep" into Unsworth's past, which Musk
      accepted in August 2018;[253] the investigator was later revealed to be a
      convicted felon with multiple counts of fraud.[254] On August 30, using
      details produced during the alleged investigation,[255][256] Musk sent a
      BuzzFeed News reporter who had written about the controversy an email
      prefaced "off the record". It claimed that Unsworth is a "single white guy
      from England who's been traveling to or living in Thailand for 30 to 40
      years ... until moving to Chiang Rai for a child bride who was about 12
      years old at the time" (later stated by Unsworth's partner to be false).
      On September 5, the reporter tweeted a screenshot of the email, saying
      that "Off the record is a two-party agreement," which he "did not agree
      to".[257] In mid-September, Unsworth filed a defamation suit in Los
      Angeles federal court.[258][259] In his defense, Musk has argued that in
      slang usage "'pedo guy' was a common insult used in South Africa when I
      was growing up ... synonymous with 'creepy old man' and is used to insult
      a person's appearance and demeanor."[260] The defamation case began on
      December 4, 2019, in Los Angeles, with Unsworth seeking $190 million in
      damages.[261] During the trial Musk apologized to Unsworth again for the
      initial tweet. On December 6 the jury found in favor of Musk and ruled he
      was not liable; Musk commented: "My faith in humanity is restored."[262]
      Unsworth's lawyer, L. Lin Wood, stated: "The truth vindicated Musk and
      Unsworth. Our system of justice worked".[263] Teslaquila Elon Musk teased
      a Tesla-branded tequila in 2018 as part of an April Fool’s joke on
      Instagram. The proposed Tesla-branded tequila appeared to become closer to
      reality in October 2018 as Tesla filed an "intent to use" trademark
      application with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office.[264] The trademark
      is for distilled agave liquor. Musk reaffirmed his intention to release
      the product with a tweet, featuring a mockup of the bottle, on October 12,
      2018.[265] Mexico's Tequila Regulatory Council (CRT) publicly replied, "If
      it wants to make Teslaquila viable as a tequila it would have to associate
      itself with an authorized tequila producer, comply with certain standards
      and request authorization from Mexico's Industrial Property
      Institute."[266] Music On March 30, 2019, Musk released a rap track, "RIP
      Harambe", on SoundCloud under the name "Emo G Records".[267] The track was
      performed by Yung Jake, written by Yung Jake and Caroline Polachek, and
      produced by BloodPop.[268][269] On January 30, 2020, Musk released an EDM
      track, "Don't Doubt Ur Vibe", featuring his own lyrics and vocals.[270]
      While Guardian critic Alexi Petridis described it as "indistinguishable
      ... from umpteen competent but unthrilling bits of bedroom electronica
      posted elsewhere on Soundcloud",[271] TechCrunch said it was "not a bad
      representation of the genre".[270]
